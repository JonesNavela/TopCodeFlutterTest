# Top Code test_json

Build a basic application with the below features:
 - Accounts list with account name and balances. (Completed)
 - View Account Details. (Completed)
 - (Optional) Add new account for user
 - (Optional) Deposit Amount into Account
 - (Optional) Withdraw Amount from Account

## Challenges

The API call for some weird reason wasn't giving a response, after hours of debugging, I ended up implementing the FutureBuilder Widget to load JSON data from the server or from my local assets incase the server is down.

I also didn't manage to complete the other optional challenges due to my workload from work, but I will do so over the weekend.

Overall, it was fun!
